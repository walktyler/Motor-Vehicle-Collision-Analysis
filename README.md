# Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Analysis
An analytical study of motor vehicle collisions in New York City aimed at understanding crash severity, fatal risk, vulnerable road users, and geographic disparities, with the goal of identifying data-driven opportunities to reduce fatalities and serious injuries

# Project Background
The Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset contains detailed records of police-reported motor vehicle crashes in New York City, where each row represents a single collision event.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Fatalities & Severity Analysis: Evaluation of historical traffic accidents, focusing on the Fatal Collision Rate (FCR) and Average Injuries per Collision.
- Time & Risk Analysis: A measure on when crashes most likely to be fatal.
- Road User Vulnerability: To discover where pedestrians are most at risk.
- Geography & Equity: To identify which locations accrue the most traffic-related accidents.
