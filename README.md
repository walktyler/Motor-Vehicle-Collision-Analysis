# Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Analysis
An analytical study of motor vehicle collisions in New York City aimed at understanding crash severity, fatal risk, vulnerable road users, and geographic disparities, with the goal of identifying data-driven opportunities to reduce fatalities and serious injuries

# Project Background
The Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset contains detailed records of police-reported motor vehicle crashes in New York City, where each row represents a single collision event.

Insights and recommendations are structured around the following analytical themes:
1) ### Fatalities & Crash Severity:
    - Evaluation of long term trends in Fatal Collision Rate (FCR).
    - An analysis of Average Injuries per Collision to assess whether crashes are becoming more severe over time.
2) ### Time & Risk Patterns:
    - Comparison of crash severity between daytime and nighttime collisions
3) ### Road User Vulnerability:
    - An assessment of pedestrian, cyclist, and motorist injury and fatality exposure.
    - Identification of populations most disproportionately impacted by traffic crashes.
4) ### Geography & Equity:
    - Analysis of collisions to identify high-risk boroughs and locations
